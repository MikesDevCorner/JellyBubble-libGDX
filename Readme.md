Jelly is a game prototype, designed and planned for mobile and developed with the Java Library LibGDX. All Artwork is done by Sebastian Stadler, Development by Michael Wagner. We moved the development to Unity3d.

## Prerequisites

You should have [OpenJDK 1.8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) installed and available on your path. AndroidStudio with the lates build tools and SDK's are necessary too. I recommend IntelliJ IDEA with libGDX Plugin for development. Image Assets are packed with AssetPacker.
